# Konfetti App

Its an app for neighborhood building thru a community todo list and a playful in-app currency called konfetti.

Android Alpha-Release APK: [DOWNLOAD] (https://github.com/rootzoll/konfetti-app/blob/master/releases/konfetti-alpha-05032016.apk?raw=true)

## Concept Notes

Get konfetti for:
- doing a task on the community todo list
- get a konfetti voucher for helping or donating

Spend konfetti on:
- creating a task on the community todo list
- upvote tasks you like on the community todo list

The app is part of the refugeehackathon, Berlin 2015 - so konfetti exchange can go:
- neighbor2refugee
- refugee2refugee
- refugee2neighbor

... you get the idea :D

## Building App from Source

Make sure to have the IONIC framework installed (v1.x): http://ionicframework.com

Checkout from git, run 'ionic state reset' and then 'ionic resources' with project folder.


## Running local Server

You need to have Maven installed. Check with 'mvn --version'.

To run server on localhost, go into 'api' folder and run 'mvn spring-boot:run'.
